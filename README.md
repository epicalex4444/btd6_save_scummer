# btd6_save_scummer
to use the save scummer download the correct file for your operating system, linux file should work on all unix based os's but it's untested. Then you need to download the latest version of python if you haven't done that already. Then you just run the python script this can easily be done on windows through powershell using the command py -3 save_scummer_windows.py or on linux using through your terminal program using python3 save_scummer_linux.py. Note those commands will only work if you are in the correct directory, you can run it from a different directory though as the files are not dependent on the current working directory  
  
you could also try making a standalone program if you want but when i tried to do that using pyinstaller --noconsole --onefile save_scummer_windows.py the exe got deleted by windows defender when I tried to run it lol, so best of luck if you wan to do that.  
  
I know the gui is shit if you want to make it better you can create a pull request but I probably wont improve it because making guis is obnoxious
