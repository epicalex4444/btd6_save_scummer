# btd6_save_scummer
To use the save scummer download the correct file for your operating system, linux file should work on all unix based os's but it's untested. Then you need to download the latest version of python if you haven't done that already. Then you just run the python script this can easily be done on windows through powershell using the command py -3 save_scummer_windows.py or on linux using through your terminal program using python3 save_scummer_linux.py. Note those commands will only work if you are in the correct directory, you can run it from a different directory though as the files are not dependent on the current working directory.  
  
When you make a save you must exit out of the game to home before you make the save, this is because btd6 doesn't actually update the save file until you exit the game
